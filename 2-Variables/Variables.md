# Variable

## Variable Declarations

To use variables in JavaScript, we first need to create it i.e. declare a variable. To declare variables, we use one of the **var**, **let**, or **const** keywords.

## Variable Scope

Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript variables had only **Global Scope** and **Function Scope**.
ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: **let** and **const**.

## Hoiting

Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top.

Variables defined with let and const are hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized.
Meaning: The block of code is aware of the variable, but it cannot be used until it has been declared.
